## 📖 Introduction

This paper introduces SVE-Math, a novel approach to solving visual mathematical reasoning tasks by integrating fine-grained visual perception into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Traditional MLLMs often struggle with visual reasoning due to their limited ability to recognize and interpret geometric primitives and spatial locations. SVE-Math is the first to design GeoGLIP (Geometric-Grounded Language-Image Pre-training), a lightweight, geometry-aware visual model with multitask learning capabilities, including **shape grounding, junction detection, and boundary detection**. GeoGLIP integrates seamlessly with diverse LLM backbones without requiring modifications to their reasoning components. Our framework aims to bridge the gap between visual perception and logical reasoning for mathematical problems, providing a robust system capable of addressing mathematical challenges through fine-grained visual perception.

## 🚀 Features

- **Lightweight and Modular Design**: Seamlessly integrates into existing LLMs (e.g., [LLaMA2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/llama2), [Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct) and [DeepSeek-Math-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-instruct)), requiring minimal computational overhead.
- **Fine-Grained Visual Understanding**: GeoGLIP is trained on multiple tasks using box- and pixel-level supervision to ensure precise perception of geometric primitives and visual entities.
- **Mind’s Eye**:  Unlike previous works that focus on constructing large-scale mathematical visual instruction datasets for training MLLMs, our approach emphasizes visual-centric tasks. It complements reasoning-focused methods by addressing the gap in visual perception—an area that has received less attention in existing research.
- **State-of-the-Art Results among 7B counterparts**: SVE-Math-Qwen2.5-7B outperforms other 7B models by 15\% on MathVerse and is compatible with GPT-4V on MathVista (50.4\% vs. 49.9\%). Despite being trained on smaller datasets (Geo170K), our method matches the performance of models trained on significantly larger datasets, evaluated on GeoQA (79.6\%).

## 🌟 Training 
Please load the model weights, including the LLM Qwen-2.5 and our visual encoder GeoGLIP. For convenience, we have released the model [Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct-GeoGLIP](https://huggingface.co/zs0506/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct-GeoGLIP) for easy access. You sholud save it in the checkpoint folder before launching the training scripts.
